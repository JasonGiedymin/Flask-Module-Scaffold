== What is this? ==
Use this scaffold / template as a basis for a Subapp / Module based Flask 
application using subdomains and subapps content. There is also an example
of using a subapp / module to extend root app space.

The application relies on Fabric to start, and includes staging
functionality to auto install all required dependencies.

== How To Use this? ==
First you'll need to edit your hosts file to direct the 'dummy' subdomain to localhost.
1. Edit /etc/hosts
2. Add an entry for "127.0.0.1  dummy.localhost"

Start installing dependencies and run the app:
1. Clone this repo
2. pip install fabric
3. cd Flask-Module-Scaffold/src
4. fab -l #Lists all commands
5. fab staging_local #Creates virtualenv and pip installs
6. fab start_dev_server #Starts the dev server

== The app is running, now what? ==
Navigate to these pages:
    # Served from the 'frontend' subapp/module
    # Templates and CSS served from frontend/[static,templates]
    http://localhost:8080
    http://localhost:8080/template
    
    # Served from the 'dummy' subbapp/module
    # Templates and CSS served from dummy/[static,templates]
    http://dummy.localhost:8080/
    http://dummy.localhost:8080/template
    
    # Served from the 'root' subapp/module using the main apps static/template
    # directories.
    # Templates and CSS served from root myapp/[static,templates]
    # To prove this, apps/root/ is devoid of the static and templates directories.
    http://localhost:8080/hello
    http://localhost:8080/root-template
