Introducing Flaskr
==================

We will call our blogging application flaskr here, feel free to chose a
less web-2.0-ish name ;)  Basically we want it to do the following things:

1. let the user sign in and out with credentials specified in the
   configuration.  Only one user is supported.
2. when the user is logged in he or she can add new entries to the page
   consisting of a text-only title and some HTML for the text.  This HTML
   is not sanitized because we trust the user here.
3. the page shows all entries so far in reverse order (newest on top) and
   the user can add new ones from there if logged in.

We will be using SQlite3 directly for that application because it's good
enough for an application of that size.  For larger applications however
it makes a lot of sense to use `SQLAlchemy`_ that handles database
connections in a more intelligent way, allows you to target different
relational databases at once and more.  You might also want to consider
one of the popular NoSQL databases if your data is more suited for those.

Here a screenshot from the final application:
