Tutorial
========

You want to develop an application with Python and Flask?  Here you have
the chance to learn that by example.  In this tutorial we will create a
simple microblog application.  It only supports one user that can create
text-only entries and there are no feeds or comments, but it still
features everything you need to get started.  We will use Flask and SQLite
as database which comes out of the box with Python, so there is nothing
else you need.
