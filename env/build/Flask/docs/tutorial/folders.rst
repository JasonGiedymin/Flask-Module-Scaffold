Step 0: Creating The Folders
============================

Before we get started, let's create the folders needed for this
application::

    /flaskr
        /static
        /templates

The `flaskr` folder is not a python package, but just something where we
drop our files.  Directly into this folder we will then put our database
schema as well as main module in the following steps.  The files inside
the `static` folder are available to users of the application via `HTTP`.
This is the place where css and javascript files go.  Inside the
`templates` folder Flask will look for `Jinja2`_ templates.  Drop all the
templates there.

Continue with :ref:`tutorial-schema`.
